# AI Academic Feedback Assistant

![Main Image](static/main.jpg)
Developed with [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://www.nvidia.com/en-au/deep-learning-ai/solutions/data-science/workbench/), AI Academic Feedback Assistant empowers academic graders by automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks like document summarization, highlighting key points in lengthy papers, aligning document with grading criteria, providing formal feedback & response, and analyzing complaint emails to pinpoint specific issues. 

Users can focus on streamline their workflow, while NVIDIA AI Workbench automatically optimized their GPU power locally and privately with the help of NVIDIA AI Workbench. For more technical users, different models and customizable prompts are available for testing.

## Background & Inspiration

Recently, it took **five weeks** for my assignment to be graded, sparking a wave of complaint emails from fellow students. Instead of addressing each one individually, the graders posted a brief announcement to ease the tension. After some asking, I discovered that over **350 submissions** had been manually graded by just two graders, one of whom was part-time! Clearly, this wasnâ€™t sustainable.

That's when inspiration struck. I came up with an idea to automate and accelerate the grading process. Over time, I expanded the concept, realizing its potential to be applied across multiple domains.
