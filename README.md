## Background & Inspiration

Recently, it took **five weeks** for my assignment to be graded, sparking a wave of complaint emails from fellow students. Instead of addressing each one individually, the graders posted a brief announcement to ease the tension. After some asking, I discovered that over **350 submissions** had been manually graded by just two graders—one of whom was part-time! Clearly, this wasn’t sustainable.

That's when inspiration struck. I came up with an idea to automate and accelerate the grading process. Over time, I expanded the concept, realizing its potential to be applied across multiple domains.
