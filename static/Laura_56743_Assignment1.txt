Football analysis report

StudentID: 56743

I don't have much experience with football. However, I do watch footbal with my dad. He used to watch football every Saturday, cheering for his favorite teams. He was so loud that we received many complaints from the neigborhood. My mom always cooked pasta on Saturday night, so we call these days spagetball day. I watch the football match and I can feel the atmosphere at the stadium, where people non-stop scream and dance.
