# AI Teaching Assistant

Developed with NVIDIA AI Workbench, AI Assistant automates time-consuming tasks such as document summarization, finding critical points in a long document, mapping document parts to corresponding business logic/criterias, reading complaint emails and pinpoint the issues. All of these features are done locally, privately

Users can try different models to test performance and customize prompts to get better results.

Developed with NVIDIA AI Workbench, AI Teaching Assistant helps any academic graders automate time-consuming tasks such as document summarization, finding critical points in a long document, mapping document parts to corresponding marking criterias, reading complaint emails and pinpoint the issues.


## Background & Inspiration

Recently, it took five weeks for my assignment to be graded, sparking a wave of complaint emails from fellow students. Instead of addressing each one individually, the graders posted a brief announcement to ease the tension. After some digging, I discovered that over 350 submissions had been manually graded by just two graders—one of whom was part-time! Clearly, this wasn’t sustainable.

That's when inspiration struck. I came up with an idea to automate and accelerate the grading process. Over time, I expanded the concept, realizing its potential to be applied across multiple domains.
